# Describe the problem in graphs terminology
## What are our nodes? numbers/people
## What are our edges? if a descendant/parent
## Directed graph

# Build your graph or write getNeighbors()
## Can do either

# Choose your fighter!
## Which algorithm in this situation?
### BFS, DFS, BFT, DFT

## Search or a traversal?
## More like a traversal: visit every possible from your starting node

## Depth vs Breadth
## BF --> shortest path
## DF --> heads to leaves first

## DF can be recursive, but not BF
